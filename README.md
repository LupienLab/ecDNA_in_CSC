This folder contains all the scripts required for the analyses presented in this project on ecDNA in CSCs.

The scripts are organized according to the analyses described in the study (e.g., CNV calling, ecDNA calling, single-cell ATAC-seq analysis, ecDNA-positive cell identification, differential accessibility analysis, and motif enrichment). 

Each script is annotated to indicate its purpose and the corresponding figure(s) in the manuscript. Scripts used to generate supplementary figures have been integrated into the folders for the main figures.
